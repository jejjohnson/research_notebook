# Jensens Inequality

This theorem is one of those [sleeper theorems](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2012/12/10/sleeper-theorems/) which comes up in a big way in many machine learning problems. 

The Jensen inequality theorem states that for a convex function $f$, 

$$\mathbb{E} [f(x)] \geq f(\mathbb{E}[x])$$

A convex function (or concave up) is when there exists a minimum to that function. If we take two points on any part of the graph and draw a line between them, we will be above or at (as a limit) the minimum point of the graph. We can flip the signs for a concave function. But we want the convex property because then it means it has a minimum value and this is useful for minimization strategies. Recall from Calculus class 101: let's look at the function $f(x)=\log x$.

We can use the second derivative test to find out if a function is convex or not. If $f'(x) \geq 0$ then it is concave up (or convex). I'll map out the derivatives below:

$$f'(x) = \frac{1}{x}$$
$$f''(x) = -\frac{1}{x^2}$$

You'll see that $-\frac{1}{x^2}\leq 0$ for $x \in [0, \infty)$. This means that $\log x$ is a concave function. So, the solution to this if we want a convex function is to take the negative $\log$ (which adds intuition as to why we typically take the negative log likelihood of many functions).

## Variational Inference

Typically in the VI literature, they add this Jensen inequality property in order to come up with the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). But I never understood how it worked because I didn't know if they wanted the convex or concave. If we think of the loss function of the likelihood $\mathcal{L}(\theta)$ and the ELBO $\mathcal{F}(q, \theta)$. Take a look at the figure from

Typically we use the $\log$ function when it's used
