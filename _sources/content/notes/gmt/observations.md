**Gap-Filling**/**Interpolation**. This often refers to filling in the missing values in the spatial domain.

**Extrapolation**. This refers to filling in the missing values outside of the spatial domain.

**Imputation**. This refers to filling in the missing values in the temporal domain.


**Forecasting**. This refers to predicting in the future.

## Self-Supervised Learning

> Creating observations when we don't have any...


### Augmentation

> adding noise to the data


### Masking

> Removing information and trying to reconstruct!

### Anomalies

> Injecting known artifacts into the data!
