## All You Need is Gaussinization

> We want to show that  

**Algorithm Highlights**

* Simple Design
* Theoretical Guarantees
* Low Number of Parameters
* Data-Dependent Initialization

**Algorithm Improvements**

* Convolutions - showcase the orthogonal parameterization works well (1x1, Exponential)
* Flexible Mixture Class - Gaussian, Logistic
* Coupling - data-dependent element-wise layers (MixtureCDF + InverseCDF)
* Multiscale - Wavelets, Reshaping
* Dimension Reduction - Slicing

**New Datasets**

* BigEarthNet
* Hyperspectral Images
* Emulation Data

**Updated Theoretical Formulation**

* Mixtures Approximate Anything
* Uniformization goes to any distribution
* Marginal Gaussianization moves towards non-Gaussianity
* Linear layers don't make the convergence worse
