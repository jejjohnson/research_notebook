## CMIP5

The climate models that everyone raves about. They have:

* historical datasets (1850-2005) - models with references to observations
* Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) datasets (1950-2005) provides oceanic variables used in the models
* Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP)(2006-2100) (and sometimes 2100-2300) - ensemble of climate projections.

An example listing of the datasets can be found [here](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/projections-cmip5-monthly-single-levels?tab=overview)

## CMIP6

The new and updated models. This was just released on the CDS this year!

## ERA5

A nice reanalysis dataset that can be used. They typically have datasets from 1979 until the present.
